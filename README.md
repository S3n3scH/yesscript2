# yesscript2
## YesScript2, Firefox Webextension, blocks scripts on specified sites

Clicking the toolbar icon does the following:

It marks the domain of the active tab untrusted in the local storage and reloads it and will not allow any scripts to be run from it anymore until clicking the icon again.

*This is a work in progress. This extension can be tested from Firefox by opening the page about:debugging and loading the manifest file in it.*

*It is the remake of the YesScript addon that will be incompatible with Firefox version 57+.*
