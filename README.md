# YesScript2
## WebExtension for browsers blocking scripts on specific sites

Clicking the toolbar icon does the following:

**It marks the domain of the active tab untrusted in the local storage and reloads it and will not allow any scripts to be run from it anymore until clicking the icon again. Its sole purpose is to give an option for the user to stop a website eating up resources or doing malicious things even if it breaks functionality of the page.**

*This is a work in progress. Currently available for Firefox platform only, see the official addon page:*

*It is the remake of the YesScript addon that will be incompatible with Firefox version 57+. See more info here:*
