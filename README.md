# YesScript2
## YesScript 2, Firefox Webextension, blocks scripts on specific sites

Clicking the toolbar icon of YesScript2 does the following:

It marks the domain of the active tab untrusted in the local storage and reloads it and will not allow any scripts to be run from it anymore until you click the icon on it again.

*This is a work in progress. This extension can be tested from Firefox by opening the page about:debugging and loading the manifest file.*

*It is the remake of the YesScript addon that will be incompatible with Firefox version 57+.*
