# YesScript2
## Firefox WebExtension, blocks scripts on specific sites

Clicking the toolbar icon does the following:

It marks the domain of the active tab untrusted in the local storage and reloads it and will not allow any scripts to be run from it anymore until clicking the icon again. Its sole purpose is to give an option for the user to stop a website eating up resources or doing malicious things even if it breaks functionality of the page.

*This is a work in progress. This extension can be tested from Firefox by opening the page about:debugging and loading the manifest file in it.*

*It is the remake of the YesScript addon that will be incompatible with Firefox version 57+.*

I take no responsibility whatsoever in regards of this software, use it at your own risk.
