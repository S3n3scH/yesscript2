# YesScript2
## WebExtension for browsers blocking scripts on specific sites

Clicking the toolbar icon does the following:

**It marks the domain of the active tab untrusted, reloads the page and blocks scripts from running on it. An option for the user to stop a website eating up resources or doing malicious things even if it breaks functionality of the page.**

*It is the complete rewrite of the YesScript addon that will be incompatible from Firefox version 57. Currently available for Firefox browser only, see the official addon page for more info:*
